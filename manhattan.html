        <p>Penelope is a cute, chic and comfortable restaurant in Kips Bay that caters to both herbivores and carnivores.
        During my recent visit I feasted on a veggie burger (shown above) while my friend dined on their hearty spinach pie
        accompanied by a zesty salad.
        I'm a burger fanatic and this is absolutely the best one I've ever eaten. The texture, consistency,
        as well as savory flavors makes this an easy favorite of mine and also a great choice for anyone who has never tried a veggie-based
        burger. Be sure to try their polenta fries... and for fish eaters, I've also heard the salmon burger is pretty yummy.
        Penelope is also a neighborhood favorite for their breakfast menu and is always packed in the AM!</p>
        
        <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
