        <p>Star is a super-unripe vegetarian from Harlem. She gave up all critters and creatures that walk, crawl, slither, 
        swim, etc., after one too many animal documentaries paired with wine. Star enjoys going out to eat with friends and initially 
        one of the challenges she faced was finding vegetarian-friendly meals in restaurants. Star is now on a 
        mission to share every vegetarian and vegan-friendly meals she finds throughout the boroughs of Manhattan, the 
        Bronx, and Brooklyn. She hopes to inspire everyone around to try a vegetarian meal while skipping town.</p>
