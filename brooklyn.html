        <p>M.O.B. is a completely <strong>VEGAN</strong> restaurant located near the Atlantic Terminal in Downtown Brooklyn!
        I chose this spot to present because it's one of my favorites in Brooklyn and it's one where you won't have to
        wait forever to sit and enjoy a great meal. M.O.B. is a communal style eatery with rather interesting decor. 
        Pictured above I indulged in a delicious "MOB dog" made from chickpeas, spiced carrot and mushrooms and garnished 
        with sauerkraut, ketchup and mustard. One word.... HEAVENLY. What I love about M.O.B. is everything is freshly made and
         full of rich flavors. For those who may already be vegan and used to preparing meals at home, this is a great go-to
         stop. :)</p>
