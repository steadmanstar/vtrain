        <p>Jahlookova is a vegetarian restaurant located right off the Concourse (B/D line) on 170th street and disclaimer: 
        it is <strong>NOT</strong> a sit-in style restaurant. It offers however, a variety of healthy/health-conscious food & drink for anyone
        on the go. 
        Jahlookova has a variety of fresh juices and smoothies, salads and hearty vegetarian meals with a Caribbean/West-Indian 
        flare. If you're from the BX you'll feel right at home in this sweet spot. What I love about Jahlookova is that
         it's absolutely a rare gem in that it provides organic foods to the community. Good vibes only! </p>
        
        
       <h3>Buen provecho!</h3>
