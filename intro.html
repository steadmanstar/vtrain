        <p>The V-train is an <u>express</u> ride through NYC, taking passengers to some of the best vegan and 
        vegetarian restaurants throughout New York City. The V train- much like the 2,4 and 5 trains- starts in the The Bronx 
        and goes through Manhattan, making it's final destination in Brooklyn. The V also allows for connection to the 
        Shuttlebus for connection to other destinations as honorable mentions.</p>
