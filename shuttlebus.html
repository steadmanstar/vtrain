        <p>The <span id="name">SHUTTLEBUS</span> is a means of transit to get you from select NYPL branches to nearby vegetarian and
        vegan hotspots. Here are some of these hotspots. :)</p>

        <p>Now this one is a bit of a stretch... but if you're ever at <span id="name4">The Brooklyn Public Library</span> either at the Central Library branch, the Bedford branch
        or hopefully somewhere in between you have to stop by <li><a href="http://vegetarianpalate.com/menu.html">Vegetarian Palate</a></li>. Located in Prospect
        Heights this a staple restaurant in the community serving completely meat-free and vegetarian spins of classic Chinese-style cuisine. Bonus: They Deliver!
